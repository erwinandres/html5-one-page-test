# HTML5 One Page Test
The most used HTML5 elements together in one file ready for tests.

This is the file I use to test the stylesheets in my web projects. In this file I attempt to put together the most popular HTML5 elements.

## How to use
If you want to use this file just

- download the test.html file and copy it to your projects folder,
- remove the HTML elements you don't need,
- add others HTML elements you may need,
- link the stylesheet files to test and finally
- open the test.html file in your browser.
